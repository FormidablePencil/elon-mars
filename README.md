Can be found everywhere lots, computed, vuex, templating syntax (@click, in-for etc.),

APIs
Vuex store

Example of watch implemented correctly (good for asynchronous operations. Apis are in vuex store).

Self reflection: few days fiddling in vue. You can see the commits. Did a similar thing with angular; learned angular in a day and the next made an app with it - link to movie app. All web concepts are the same in all frameworks. You learn on you know them all. Vue is a fairly simple and easy to use. I've been a React fan boy for as long as I can remember but now Vue is my personal fav.

Tailwind. Compartmentalized.

Features:
1. Search and embedded results vid/img
2. Sol data
3. Countdown timer


notes.wiki my thinking process

Modularized.

- In new Date() format you can adjust the countdown. The value are not fixed. 

- Mars' sol api: 
- Story by date feature api: 
If video,video will render. If image, image will render."

Vuex store:
- holds api data fetched
- story by date feature triggered status

Created, mounted and watch (and maybe vuex may have something).
Look up methods of cue
Asynchronous use properly
I may have added computed stuff where they should be in method. Again, what's the difference
Needs to be more detailed
Add reference points (I wonder if github has just to specific num in doc feature.
Fully modularized, fully responsive, cross browser supported.
Cross browser compatable.
